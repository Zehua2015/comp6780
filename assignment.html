    <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
      <a href="index.html">index page</a>
      <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
      <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
    delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
    mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
    differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
    better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
    look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
    might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
    it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
    it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
    style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
    assignment tasks.</li>
      <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
      <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>

    <h1><b>Website Release 2.0</b></h1>
    <h2><b>2.1 Call to Actions</b></h2>
    <p>Primary CTA:</p>
    <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>
    <p>Secondary CTA:</p>
    <a href="movies.html">Movies Page</a>
    <p>Notes: For primary CTA, I put it on my home page (index.html), after animation, there is a "explore" button to explore the Star Wars universe, which is the topic of this website.</p>
    <P>For Secondary CTA, I put it on the bottom movies page (which can be accessed from home page (index.html)) -- there is a explore gallery button, directing to gallery.</P>
    <h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
    <a href="gallery.html">gallery page</a>
    <p>Notes: Images in gallery can be expanded by clicking the image, and there are left and right arrow to go to the prev / next image. Close button also attached at right-top corner.</p>
    <h2><b>2.3 &amp; 2.4 Storyboard + Video / Javascript</b></h2>
    <p>I am doing Javascript, with following files.</p>
    <a href="galleryPageJs.js">galleryPageJs.js</a><br>
    Notes: galleryPageJs.js is for style for gallery page the page, with function click to expand the iamge, etc.<br>
    <a href="myHomePage.js">myHomePage.js</a><br>
    Notes:<br>
     1. This JavaScript file is essential for the entire homepage for optimal performance.<br>
     2. It contains functions like fadeIn(), fadeOut(), handleAnimationEnd(), and skipAnimation(): 
        fadeIn(), fadeOut(): for fade in / out animations.<br>
        handleAnimationEnd(): when "Star wars" demo animation ends, use callback function to retrieve next page.<br>
        skipAnimation(): press space button to skip the animation, which I think is particularlly useful.<br>
     3. To maintain clarity and manageability, related JavaScript functions are grouped together in this single file.<br>
     5. The home page includes animations:<br>
        a) fade in "Star Wars" demo animation with "COMP6780 website" subtitle, then fade out.<br>
        b) fade in "author text", then fade out.<br>
        c) shows primary CTA button (page) with R2D2 (droid) moving animation.<br>
            p.s. the primary CTA button would direct to session page (using js for link instead of 'a href').<br>  
            p.s.s. the R2D2 droid could also be clicked to direct to session page. <br>
    <a href="tablePagination.js">tablePagination.js</a><br>
    Note:
      this Javascript file is for table pagination for source log, which includes next / prev button,
      source log format, etc.<br>
    <a href="moviesPageJs.js">moviesPageJs.js</a><br>
    Note: This JavaScript is mainly for controlling popping up movie-info session when mouse hover, ect.

    <h1><b>Website Release 3.0</b></h1>
    <h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
    <a href="me.html"> Me and my passion page</a>
    <p>Notes: Reflection attached under the Original about me page.</p>
    <h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
    <a href="./mode.css">mode.css</a>
    <a href="movies.html">Movies Page</a>
    <p>Notes: My Alternative css file is to make the web into a more printer friendly mode.</p>
    <p>Notes: As observed on my movie page, movie information only pops up when the mouse hovers over the corresponding movie image. When the mouse leaves that specific image —and not the corresponding movie info— the information folds away. This method presents a well-designed page but is not printer-friendly. (Figure 1)
      Figure 1 illustrates that when printing the website in its original mode (referred to as dark mode because of the website's dark theme), the movie information is hidden, and the format appears disorganized. However, switching to a printer-friendly mode (light mode) using the button results in a perfect output, as shown in Figures 2 and 3.
      Additionally, this mode allows the website to appear more concise and clean.</p>

      Figure 3 Printing Result with light mode 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s) or Feed(s)</b></h2>
    <a href="movies.html">Movies Page</a>
    <p>Notes: I choose the implement Social Networking Button(s) for this part. I put Weibo, Facebook, Twitter (X) share button on the right top side of the movie website. When clicking, it will lead us to the share page of corresponding social media.
      i.e. Share link with description if applicable.
    </p>
    <h2><b>3.4 Website Accesibility</b></h2>
    <p>Replace this line with your URL link to this element in your website.</p>
    <p>Acoording to google's LightHouse I have 100 accessibility for almost all my website page. (all website accessibility > 95)</p>
    <img src="./img/accessibility.jpg" style="width: 360px; "><br>
    <p>Figure: accessibility Image</p>
    <p>Notes: For the following requirements:<br>
    •	<b>All media has a descriptive alternative text:</b> I make sure that every image have an alt element.<br>
    •	<b>Proper Headings structure is used.</b> I am using proper h1-h6 headings and also design my own headings font size using css file, etc.<br>
    •	<b>All icon sizes are at least 45 x 45 pixels:</b> The smallest images in my website are top-left logo, contact icon and share button icons. I have set scales of all of them to at least 45*45 pixel. (which could observed from <a href="default.css">default.css</a> ".header-content img")<br>
    •	<b>All site elements are accessible using the tab key on your keyboard:</b> All elements are clickable in my website, and could be directed next or prev using tab<br>
    •	<b>All href links have an aria-label associated with them:</b> I have add aria-label for every href links.<br>
    •	<b>Abbreviations in content have an abbr tag associated with them:</b>I do not have abbr in my website assignment.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><b>3.5 Website Validation</b></h2>
    <a href="validation.html">Validation</a>
    <p>Notes: I put all html and css validation image to this page. All come with no errors.</p>
    <h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
    <a href="helpButton.js">helpButton.js</a><br>
    <a href="mode.js">mode.js</a><br>
    <a href="galleryPageJs.js">galleryPageJs.js</a><br>
    <a href="toTop.js">toTop.js</a><br>
    <a href="dropDown.js">dropDown.js</a><br>
    <p>I made <a href="helpButton.js">helpButton.js</a> which generates a help button for every pages.
    When Clicking this help button, three additional buttons "More","Main","Top" buttons pops up in which:
    More button leads to StarWars official website.
    Main button leads to my index home page.
    Top button leads to top of current website. (p.s. Top button will check if user is currently at the top and change the opacity accordingly.)
    When click that help button again, the three additional buttons will be folded. All of the buttons are accessible from tab key.
  </p>
    <p>I try to make the website functional with every minor aspects. For example, I create <a href="mode.js">mode.js</a> to manage the gallery modal control, i.e. one could now use left, right arrow and esc to control the image.
    Additionally, I make significant changes on <a href="galleryPageJs.js">galleryPageJs.js</a> to make the images format in an interesting way.</p>
    <p>I wrote <a href="toTop.js">toTop.js</a> to have scrolling up animation from end to the top of website in <a href="movies.html">Movies Page</a> and <a href="me.html">About me Page</a>.</p>
    <p> I wrote <a href="dropDown.js">dropDown.js</a> for controlling tab controll in all drop down menu.</p>
